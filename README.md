Google Calendar Schedule automation.
This script is beneficial to secretaries. When a meeting mail arrives, I needed to write it into google sheets, and then add it into the calendar of my boss. Afterwards, I had to add the meeting notes as i file into Google Drive and paste the link into google sheets. I've combined the process of writing into google sheets and adding a new schedule into google calendar. 
What does the code do?
Every 1 hour, the code will scan the sheet, and if there is new row, i.e new meeting, it will create a new schedule in google calendar.
Every 1 hour, the code will scan the sheet, and if there are changes in existing rows, it will add the change to the already created schedule in google calendar.
